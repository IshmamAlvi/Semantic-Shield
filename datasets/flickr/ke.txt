The visual scene depicts an older man with a graying beard, possibly a homeless person, who is sleeping on the grass in front of an ancient tree in a public park. The man may be wearing ragged or tattered clothing, and his belongings may be scattered around him. The ancient tree in the background provides a sense of history and grandeur to the scene, and the public park setting suggests that this is a common sight for those who frequent the area. The fact that the man is sleeping on the grass implies that he has nowhere else to go, and that he is seeking shelter and respite from the world.

['women in Afghanistan', 'cover themselves', 'must wear the burqa']

This visual scene depicts women in Afghanistan who are required to cover themselves according to the country's conservative dress code. The women are typically dressed in a burqa, a garment that covers the entire body except for a small opening for the eyes. The burqa is often worn with a hijab, or headscarf, which covers the hair and neck. The scene may depict women walking in the streets, shopping in markets, or going about their daily lives while covered in the traditional Islamic attire. The visual scene may also evoke feelings of oppression, as the requirement to wear the burqa is often seen as a restriction on women's freedom and rights.
